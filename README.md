Freewriting Web App is published [here](https://katarita.github.io/freewriting/), so go ahead and give it a try :)

### Free Writing Technique

Free writing is a process of writing down everything you're thinking about in order to clear your mind and become more productive.

It's the way you can handle your emotions, lower their intensity so that you can get more concentrated on work or study, etc.

Free writing makes you more balanced and structured, and practicing it on a regular basics can even be used as a free self-therapy method.

It's recommended but not necessarily to practice writing first thing in the morning, because morning is the best time to connect to your subconsciousness and meet something really important in it's depth.

### Privacy

At the moment, the application does not store any of your data, everything you write will be kept in the Local Storage of your browser.

### Additional info

Freewriting is my pet project, I love it and use it by myself.
It's under construction, but it already has enough functionality to be effectively used.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
